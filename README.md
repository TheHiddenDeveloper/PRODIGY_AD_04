# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game for Android devices. The app will allow two players to take turns marking the board with 'X' or 'O' symbols. The game will determine the winner or a tie and provide a reset option to start a new game.

## Features:

- Two-Player Mode: Players can take turns making moves on the 3x3 grid.
- Win Detection: The app detects win conditions for both players.
- Tie Game Detection: The app detects tie games when the board is full.
- Reset Button: Resets the game board to start a new game.
- Turn Indicator: Visually indicates the current player's turn.
